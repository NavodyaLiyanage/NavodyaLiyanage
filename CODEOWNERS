You have to choose EHI Files with name *Facebook*. Then, you can browse other sites from your facebook only unlimited data package.\n\n4️⃣ Now, click on your selected EHI file and open from HTTP Injector.\n\n5️⃣ Click *Start* button to connect EHI config.\n\nNow you can ENJOY UNLIMITED DATA.\n\nIf your connection slow, change EHI files from another server (US 01, US 02, SG).\n\nThese EHI files only valid for *30days* from import date. After that you have to get another set of EHI and renew. And also you can change server from Injector app settings.\n\n```Queen Aneshiya Team💃🏻♥️```"
